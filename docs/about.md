I am Bernadette Stolz, a mathematician studying topology in biomedical data at the [Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/en) in the [Department of Machine Learning and Systems Biology](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/borgwardt) where I lead the project group "Topological Learning for Biomedicine". My research focuses on designing sophisticated computational methods with roots in algebra, geometry, and topology to find and understand patterns in biomedical data. My additional background in [molecular medicine](https://www.umg.eu/en/study-and-teaching/studieren-an-der-umg/study-programmes/molecular-medicine/#:~:text=The%20basic%20Bachelor's%20degree%20in,invited%20to%20complete%20the%20test.) allows me to work on exciting problems at the intersection of mathematics, computational biology, and biomedicine. I am a member of [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu), my work has received national and international awards.

Previously, I held postdoctoral positions at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in the [Laboratory for Topology and Neuroscience](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/hessbellwald-lab/) and in the [Centre for Topological Data Analysis](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/topological-data-analysis) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk). I completed my PhD in 2020 at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford, as part of the Systems Approaches to Biomedical Sciences Centre for Doctoral Training ([SABS CDT](https://www.sabsr3.ox.ac.uk/home)) in collaboration with [Roche](https://www.roche.ch/en/home).

Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss research or potential collaborations! I also welcome inquiries from motivated students interested in thesis supervision or internships.
